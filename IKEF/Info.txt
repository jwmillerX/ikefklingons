I am wondering if we can make the Public Area and Members Area look like the above and take the additional stuff out that would be an awesome start to the Forum.

Here's the ships I got so far.  As you can see, there are 2 I think that did not check in.  I think it was an oversight on their part cause they are certainly active.  I am waiting on the full Klingon name and rank of the commander of the IKV K'Dot and that will make 11 ships.

Now what I need to do is give you a layout of What area is Qo'noS Sector and Mempa Sector and what Fleets are in each Sector.  Hang tight, it's on it's way.

I know this map isnt the greatest, but it will at least show you the Sectors.  Qo'noS Sector is North and South America, Canada, and Greenland.  Mempa Sector is Europe, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.  Russia, Asia, and the Middle East Will be recognized As part of Mempa Sector if and when we get membership there.

Next I'll give info on the Fleets in Qo'noS Sector
1st Fleet - Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia
2nd Fleet - New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Deleware, Rhode Island, Maryland, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine
3rd Fleet - Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama

4th Fleet - Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri

5th Fleet - Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas,
6th Fleet - California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada
7th Fleet - Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska

Mempa Sector 
2nd Fleet - UK, Scotland, Ireland, Wales


These are the Fleets in the U.S. with the exception of the 2nd Fleet.  Mississippi is also in the 3rd Fleet as well.  My apologies for the overload of info, but I was on a roll and didn't want to delay.  Talk to you soon.   Qapla'
